# AQI-prediction-usingTemporal-Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning- A Case Study

    Naive Bayes classification and Gradient Descent algorithms were applied to get the

minimum error with respect to prediction of the air quality in india. A fuzzy inference system was

introduced to perform parameter classification using a reasoning process and integrating them into an air quality index.
